# Staking


## How It Works
1. Staking rewards are calculated and distributed to all stakers once per day at a predetermined time.
2. Stakers must have their STRIKE stake locked for at least 1 full day before they start earning rewards.
3. All rewards are paid out in ADA.
4. Stakers can add or remove part of the staked STRIKE
5. Stakers can unlock their rewards or withdraw all of their stake anytime
